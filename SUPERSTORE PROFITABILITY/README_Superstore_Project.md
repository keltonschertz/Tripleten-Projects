## Project Overview

You have been hired as a consultant to analyze the operations of the Superstore and provide insights to increase profitability and avoid bankruptcy. This project is structured into three main parts: analyzing profits and losses, assessing advertising opportunities, and evaluating returned items.

## Part 1: Profits & Losses

### Objectives

1. **Identify Profit and Loss Centers**
   - Analyze pairs of dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, shipping mode + product ID) to find the top 2 profit centers and top 2 loss-makers.
   - Visualizations are used to justify findings.

2. **Product Elimination Recommendations**
   - Determine which specific products the Superstore should stop selling.
   - Justify with visual evidence.

3. **Subcategory Focus**
   - Recommend 3 subcategories to focus on and 3 to stop selling based on profitability.

## Part 2: Advertising

### Objectives

1. **Evaluate Advertising ROI**
   - Identify the top 3 combinations of states and months for advertising based on average monthly profit.
   - Justify advertising budget using the return on ad spend ratio (recommendation: spend up to 1/5 of projected profits).
   - Use visualizations to highlight best opportunities.

## Part 3: Returned Items

### Objectives

1. **Return Rate Analysis**
   - Create a calculated field for `Returned`: 1 if 'Yes', 0 if null.
   - Visualize:
     - Products with the highest return rates.
     - Customers with the highest return rates.

2. **Profit vs. Return Rate Visualization**
   - Compare average profit and average return rate across a chosen dimension (e.g., state, shipping mode).
   - Provide a visual argument to support continuing or discontinuing business based on this analysis.
